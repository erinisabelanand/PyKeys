Welcome to PyKeys!
PyKeys is a piano game with preloaded levels of difficulty where bubbles fall onto their corresponding keys on a piano. The user must hit the keys on time for the score to increment. The game has two additional features, a music composition mode wherein the user can input notes saved into a file loaded as a level for the user to play, and an algorithm that analyzes where the user makes the most errors, allowing the user to practice the section again. 

How to run the project:
1) Download Zip Folder
2) Open 'Term Project Code - PyKeys.py' with VS code
3) Import Musical Beeps module through the 'pip install musicalbeeps' command on the terminal
4) Import pygame through the 'pip install pygame' command on the terminal

There are three different modes which you can enjoy:
1) Composition Mode - create your composition
